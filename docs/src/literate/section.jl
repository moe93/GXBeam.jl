# # [Computing Stiffness and Mass Matrices](@id section)

# Cross section stiffness and inertial properties are provided as direct inputs for most of the 
# examples in this package.  In general, however, we need to compute these section 
# properties from input geometry and material properties.  

# We implemented the 2D finite element procedure described by 
# [Giavotto et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/0045-7949(83)90179-7) and that is also described 
# in the [BECAS User Guide](https://backend.orbit.dtu.dk/ws/portalfiles/portal/7711204/ris_r_1785.pdf).  
# This approach is much more accurate than those based on classical laminate theory, especially for coupled 
# and transverse stiffnesses, and of course is much more accurate for thicker sections.  
# Our implementation uses bilinear quadrilateral (Q4) elements, and is tailored 
# for use in design optimization.  First, the implementation is fast.  The memory for all large matrices is 
# preallocated, in sparse formats where applicable.  This allows operations to be done in place for subsequent 
# iterations within an optimization. We also save the matrix factorization in the linear solve and use sparse 
# solvers.   Second, meshes are carefully resized to avoid discrete jumps in properties as airfoil/thickness 
# dimensions change.

# There are two main ways to compute section properties using this package.  The first is from explicit creation 
# of a mesh, i.e., nodes and elements. This is the most general approach, and can be used for any shape.  
# However, as our primary usage is for airfoils, we have a second convenience function that generates the nodes 
# and elements for a parameterized airfoil.  This approach does not require understanding the format of nodes 
# and elements, but rather the specificiations for the paramterized airfoil.  Other convenience functions could be 
# created for other common geometries.  These two different approaches are explained below, but before describing 
# them we note the material definition as that is needed in both methods.

# ## Material Properties

# We can specify a general orthotropic [`Material`](@ref) with three independent Young's moduli, shear moduli, Poisson's 
# ratios, and the material density.  ``E_i`` is the Young's modulus along axis ``i``, ``G_{ij}`` is the shear 
# modulus in direction ``j`` on the plane whose normal is in direction ``i``, and ``\nu_{ij}`` is the Poissonâ€™s 
# ratio that corresponds to a contraction in direction ``j`` when an extension is applied in direction ``i`` 
# (from symmetry the opposite definitions would also apply, where we swap ``i`` and ``j``).  
# Also from symmetry we know that ``\nu_{ij} E_j = \nu_{ji} E_i``.  For example:

using GXBeam

E1 = 10e9
E2 = 5e9
E3 = 5e9
G12 = 8e9
G13 = 4e9
G23 = 4e9
nu12 = 0.3
nu13 = 0.3
nu23 = 0.3
rho = 1.8e3

mat = Material(E1, E2, E3, G12, G13, G23, nu12, nu13, nu23, rho)

# The ply, element, and beam coordinate systems are shown below.  Axis 1 is along the ply main fiber direction, 
# 2 is the transverse direction, and 3 is normal to the ply. For a wing/blade 1 is nominally along the span/radius, 
# 2 is tangent to airfoil, and 3 is normal to airfoil (these are nominal as they would only be exact if the fiber 
# orientation, ``\theta``, is 0 degrees).

# ![](../assets/material-coordinate.png)

# ## Nodes and Elements

# The structure is discretized into nodes.  A [`Node`](@ref) is a point given by an x, y coordinate pair.  

x = 0.0
y = 0.0
node = Node(x, y)
#!jl nothing #hide

# Of course, a structure has many nodes, and these should be assembled in a vector of nodes.  The node number  
# is given by the vector index.  In this example we create four nodes in the shape of a square from which we can 
# later construct an element.

x = 0.0
y = 0.0
node1 = Node(x, y)
x = 1.0
y = 0.0
node2 = Node(x, y)
x = 1.0
y = 1.0
node3 = Node(x, y)
x = 0.0
y = 1.0
node4 = Node(x, y)

nodes = [node1; node2; node3; node4]
#!jl nothing #hide

# The structure is constructed with elements.  Each [`MeshElement`](@ref) is made of four nodes, ordered as shown below Each 
# element also has a material, and that material has a fiber orientation ``\theta`` (see previous figure).

# ![](../assets/element.png)

nodenumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
material = mat
theta = 20*pi/180
element = MeshElement(nodenumbers, material, theta)
#!jl nothing #hide

# A mesh would then consist of an array of nodes and an array of elements. As an example we construct a mesh 
# for the square cross section with isotropic material shown in the BECAS User Guide (which is just a square of 
# side length 0.1).  We discretize the square into 100 equally-sized elements, 10 in each dimension.

iso = Material(100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 41.667, 41.667, 41.667, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 1000.0)
x = range(-0.05, 0.05, length=11)
y = range(-0.05, 0.05, length=11)

nodes = Vector{Node{Float64}}(undef, 11*11)
elements = Vector{MeshElement{Vector{Int64},Float64}}(undef, 10*10)

let 
    m = 1
    for i = 1:11
        for j = 1:11
            nodes[m] = Node(x[i], y[j])
            m += 1
        end
    end

    m = 1
    for i = 1:10
        for j = 1:10
            elements[m] = MeshElement([11*(i-1)+j, 11*(i)+j, 11*(i)+j+1, 11*(i-1)+j+1], iso, 0.0)
            m += 1
        end
    end
end

# With the mesh constructed we can now compute the compliance matrix.  The [`compliance_matrix`](@ref) is computed about 
# the shear center.

S, sc, tc = compliance_matrix(nodes, elements)
#!jl nothing #hide

# S is the compliance matrix, sc is the x and y coordinates for the shear center, and tc is the x and y 
# coordinates for the tension center.  These coordinates are relative to the origin (0, 0) of the mesh.

# Inertial properties can be computed from the [`mass_matrix`](@ref) function:

M, mc = mass_matrix(nodes, elements)
#!jl nothing #hide

# where M is the mass matrix and mc is the x and y coordinates for the mass center.

# ## Airfoil Shape

# The airfoil outer mold line is defined by a set of x, y coordinates, normalized by chord. The points must 
# start at the trailing edge, traverse counterclockwise (i.e., upper surface first), and end at the trailing 
# edge as shown below.  
# The trailing edge can be blunt or sharp. For the former the trailing edge would start and end at different points, 
# and in the later they would be the same point.

# In this example we will use ST1 for the MH-104 airfoil described in the paper by 
# [Chen, Yu, and Capellaro](https://doi.org/10.1002/we.372).

# Next, we define the chord length, the twist angle, and the pitch axis.  The pitch axis is the x-coordinate, 
# measured back from the leading edge, normalized by chord, that defines where the airfoil should be twisted about
# as seen in the figure below.  
# So a pitch axis of 0.25 means that the airfoil rotates about the quarter chord.  Positive twist is in the

# The heart of the parmeterization is defining the ply sequence.  A single ply (or multiple plys of the same 
# material and orientation) is given by a Layer.  A Layer is defined by a material, a thickness, and a fiber

# in radians.  For example:

# ## Airfoil Mesh Control

# A few additional parameters are available to control the airfoil meshing.  By default the mesh is discretized 
# in the tangential direction using the airfoil coordinates. In other words, to get a finer mesh in this direction 
# we could specify more airfoil points.  By default the mesh in the normal direction uses the layers defined 
# by the segments.  Since we use the same number of elements for each segment, we subdivide some layers as needed 
# (and thus the segment with the most layers defines the number of elements).  In our above example the the 
# third segment has the most layers (7) so we discretize the mesh with 7 elements in the tangential direction 
# for all segments.  To get a finer mesh in this direction we could breakup a segment into more layers 
# (for example a layer of material 1 of 0.1 thickness could be divided into four layers of material 1 with 
# 0.025 thickness).

# However, doing this remeshing manually is a bit tedious so there are functions that can automate this.  
# First, there are two optional parameters that control the desired spacing in the tangential and normal 
# directions.  The first is "ds", which if provided, will resample the airfoil with approximately this spacing, 
# normalized by chord.  For example, ds=0.01 will create points on the airfoil spaced roughly 1% chord apart.  
# Siimilarly, there is an optional parameter "dt", which resamples the thicknesses with this maximium mesh size 
# (thickness is absolute). For example, dt=0.01, will target a maximum element thickness of 0.01. Recall that 
# the total number of elements remains constant along the airfoil, so most thicknesses will less than this
# value. This same parameter is used for discretizing along the thickness of the webs.  

# These two parameters are simple to use, but are typically not desirable for gradient-based optimization if 
# ply thicknesses or airfoil coordinates are changed.  This is because a fixed element size will experience 
# discrete jumps as the airfoil is resized.  Thus, rather than specify a fixed element size, we should specify 
# a fixed number of elements.  The optional parameters ns and nt provide this functionality.  

# The parameter ns is an array specifying the number of elements to create in each segment.  In our case we have 
# four different segments so we could define an array like: `ns = [15, 20, 40, 30]`.  This is less convenient 
# as it is not as immediately obvious how many elements should to put in each sector in order to provide a 
# consistently spaced mesh.  However, as the airfoil shape changes, the mesh will simply stretch/shrink and 
# never experience discrete jumps.  Similarly, we can specify nt to define the number of elements to use 
# across the thickness.  The parameter nt is actually an array of arrays.  Each subaray defines how many 
# elements should be used for each layer.  For example 
# `nt = [[1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 5], [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 2, 1, 2]]` would subdivide the innermost 
# layer of the first segment into 5 elements, and so on.

# Finally, for discretizing along the webs we can use `wns` and `wnt`.  The parmeter wns is an integer and 
# specifies the number of elements to use along the height of the web (same definition as ns but a web only 
# needs one number). The default is four. The parameters wnt has the same definition as nt but applies to the webs.
